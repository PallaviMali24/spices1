<h3><p>Cardamom is a spice made from the seeds of several plants in the genera <br>
Elettaria and Amomum in the family Zingiberaceae. Both genera are native <br>
to the Indian subcontinent and Indonesia. They are recognized by their small<br>
seed pods: triangular in cross-section and spindle-shaped, with a thin, papery <br>
outer shell and small, black seeds; Elettaria pods are light green and smaller,<br>
while Amomum pods are larger and dark brown.<br></p>
